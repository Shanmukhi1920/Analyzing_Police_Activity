# Analyzing_Police_Activity

Explored the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyzed the impact of gender on police behavior and further combined it with weather data of RI state to analyze the weather effects on police behaviour.

During the analysis I have gained more practice on cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data.
